      "the digital. By that I meant to refer not just to digital governance but also to digital\n",

      "we published in 2017 as a joint British Academy and Royal Society working group\n",
      "(British Academy 2017). As long as the synecdoche is clear, there is no problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, when policy-makers, both in political and in business contexts, wonder why\n",
      "we should engage in moral evaluation when legal compliance is already available (this\n",
      "is a recurring topic in the discussion of the GDPR), the answer should be clear:\n",
      "compliance is necessary but insufficient to steer society in the right direction. Because\n",
      "digital regulation indicates what the legal and illegal moves in the game are, so to\n",

      "Third, digital ethics may be understood now in two ways, as hard and soft ethics.\n",
      "Hard ethics is what we usually have in mind when discussing values, rights, duties and\n",
      "responsibilities—or, more broadly, what is morally right or wrong, and what ought or\n",
      "ought not to be done—in the course of formulating new regulations or challenging\n",
      "existing ones. In short, hard ethics is what makes or shapes the law. Thus, in the best\n",
      "scenario, lobbying in favour of some good legislation or to improve that which already\n",
      "exists can be a case of hard ethics. For example, hard ethics helped to dismantle\n",
      "apartheid in South Africa and supported the approval of legislation in Iceland that\n",
      "requires public and private businesses to prove that they offer equal pay to employees,\n",
      "irrespective of their gender (the gender pay gap continues to be a scandal in most\n",
      "countries).\n",
      "\n",
      "Soft ethics covers the same normative ground as hard ethics, but it does so by\n",
      "considering what ought and ought not to be done over and above the existing\n",
      "regulation, not against it, or despite its scope, or to change it, or to by-pass it (e.g. in\n",
      "terms of self-regulation). In other words, soft ethics is post-compliance ethics: in this\n",
      "case, ‘ought implies may’. Now, both hard and soft ethics usually presuppose feasibility\n",
      "or, in more Kantian terms, assume that ‘ought implies can’, given that an agent has a\n",

      "Surveillance culture is a product of contemporary late-modern conditions or, simply, of digital\n",
      "modernity. From the later 20th century especially, corporate and state modes of surveillance, mediated by\n",
      "increasingly fast and powerful new technologies, tilted toward the incorporation of everyday life through\n",

      "culture is formed through organizational dependence, political-economic power, security linkages, and\n",
      "social media engagement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me contrast surveillance culture with previous terms and show why, on their own, they are\n",
      "now inadequate. Surveillance state worked well in the postwar Orwellian period and can still capture\n",
      "significant aspects of surveillance, such as the activities of intelligence agencies. But even there, the\n",
      "surveillance state is heavily dependent on commercial entities—Internet and telephone companies—to\n",
      "provide the desired data (Ball et al., 2015). Although such data have been used, via warrants, by police\n",
      "and security agencies for decades, the mass scale on which this now happens alters the dynamic. Today,\n",
      "no one is unaffected by this very post-Orwellian collusion of governmental and corporate forces. A second\n",
      "factor is that many of those data are themselves generated in the first place by the everyday online\n",
      "activities of millions of ordinary citizens. We collude as never before in our own surveillance by sharing—\n",
      "whether willingly or wittingly, or not—our personal information in the online public domain. Surveillance\n",
      "culture helps situate this. If this is state surveillance, it has a deeply different character from that which in\n",
      "popular terms is “Orwellian.”\n",
      "\n",
      "If the surveillance state is an inadequate concept, the equally commonplace idea of a surveillance\n",
      "society is also insufficient for the task. Although surveillance society helps to indicate the broader context\n",
      "within which the unsettling discoveries about the mass surveillance engaged by the NSA and the “Five\n",
      "Eyes” occur, it also falls short of explaining today’s situation. Surveillance society is a concept originally\n",
      "used to indicate ways in which surveillance was spilling over the rims of its previous containers—\n",
      "government departments, policing agencies, workplaces—to affect many aspects of daily life. But the\n",
      "emphasis was still on how surveillance was carried out by certain agencies in ways that increasingly\n",
      "touched the routines of social life—from outside, as it were. This concept was often used in ways that paid\n",
      "scant attention to citizens’, consumers’, travelers’, or employees’ experience of and engagement with\n",
      "surveillance.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the later 20th century onward, surveillance became a central organizing feature of societies\n",
      "that had developed information infrastructures, in which complexity was managed using categories\n",
      "(Bennett, Haggerty, Lyon, & Steeves, 2014; Ericson & Haggerty, 2000; Lyon, 2007). By the early 21st\n",
      "century, evidence was emerging of a “third phase” of computing, after the mainframe and personal\n",
      "computer phases, where computing machinery is embedded, more-or-less invisibly, in the environments\n",
      "of everyday life. Many refer to this as evidence for the “Internet of things,” where the focus is on “smart”\n",
      "devices and objects capable of communicating with users and other devices. As we shall see, this extends\n",
      "in specific ways the reliance on surveillance as a mode of organization. Today’s surveillance culture is\n",
      "informed by these developments.\n",
      "\f",
      "International Journal of Communication 11(2017) Surveillance Culture 827\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, it is almost a truism to say that surveillance is also a major industry. Global corporations\n",
      "are involved, often with close links to government. The Snowden disclosures made this abundantly clear if\n",
      "there was any doubt previously. From the very start, in June 2013, the Snowden documents showed that\n",
      "the NSA has access to telephone company (Verizon) metadata and also mines the customer databases of\n",
      "Internet corporations such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook (often referred to as the\n",
      "“Big Five”). On the one hand, then, these corporations engage in large-scale surveillance of their\n",
      "customers. And on the other, they share these data with government agencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the character of the corporation is also important for the relation between the political\n",
      "economy and the culture of surveillance. The Big Five corporations now dominate not only the Internet but\n",
      "also the economic mode of operation, which has moved beyond the managerial and financial modes of\n",
      "accumulation that characterized the later 20th and early 21st century. As understood by Shoshana Zuboff,\n",
      "the emerging phase is surveillance capitalism, now intimately involved with big data practices (Zuboff,\n",
      "2015, 2016, Lyon 2014a). Its aim is to “predict and modify human behaviour to produce revenue and\n",
      "market control” (Zuboff, 2015, p. 75). Her analysis is based on Google's strategies that evidence a “formal\n",
      "indifference” toward its user base. For her, this has implications for what she calls “information\n",
      "civilization.” These remarks are limited to the related idea of surveillance culture that seeks to grasp how\n",
      "users’ responses to such attempted prediction and modification affects their success.\n",
      "\n",
      "This means, in turn, that links with securitization are strong and pervasive. As David Garland\n",
      "observed, surveying the late 20th-century world of policing and governance, neoliberal governance flows\n",
      "naturally from this; what he called the “culture of control” is its leading motif (Garland, 2001). Risk\n",
      "management and security was already an important surveillance motif. But a formative opportunity for its\n",
      "expansion was offered by 9/11 and its aftermath, which, significantly, relied heavily on recently ailing\n",
      "technology companies to create a new industry of “homeland security” (Lyon, 2003). Thus, one of the key\n",
      "trends of recent surveillance has been securitization, applied in numerous and ever-growing and\n",
      "intensifying areas (Bennett et al., 2014). Such securitization demands greater amounts of information\n",
      "about risk and how to handle it, which both weakens traditional privacy requirements and increases\n",
      "surveillance of what are deemed risky behaviors. In terms of surveillance culture, this reinforces the sense\n",
      "that surveillance is warranted, “for our own good.” In practice, of course, this is also understood\n",
      "ambivalently.\n",
      "\n",
      "This sense of risk, and the need to take steps to reduce it, is not only evident on the grand scale\n",
      "of (inter)national policy but also penetrates daily life at home, where self-tracking for health, income, and\n",
      "time management is an increasing phenomenon. Only a few years ago, The New York Times still thought\n",
      "of this as something for geeks and keep-fit addicts (Wolf, 2010). Today, such self-monitoring is less\n",
      "unusual and often taken for granted. Wearable devices have become increasingly popular since the first\n",
      "decade of this century, and now, talk of the “quantified self” is much more commonplace (Crawford,\n",

      "culture. I regard José van Dijck’s work (2013, 2014) as exemplary here. Her book examines social media\n",
      "cultures, and the related article expands the argument to include questions of surveillance and privacy. It\n",
      "would seem that among the Snowden revelations, the realization by broad swaths of the public that what\n",
      "happens on social media is open to both corporation and government was one of the most striking. Van\n",
      "Dijck points out how this connects with “dataism,” the secular belief—part of the surveillance imaginary, in\n",
      "my terms—that users can safely entrust their data to large corporations. Snowden put serious dents into\n",
      "dataism. Indeed, in the U.S. a recent study of Americans’ main fears shows that being tracked by\n",
      "corporations or government is close to the top of the list (Bader, 2016). It would hardly be surprising if\n",
      "such findings do not have an impact in everyday uses of social media.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Pew Internet and American Life researchers, Snowden’s disclosures have indeed had\n",
      "an impact on social media use (Rainie & Madden, 2015). For example, 34% (or 30% of all adults) of those\n",
      "aware of the government surveillance programs have taken at least one step to hide or shield their\n",
      "information from the government—changing privacy settings, using other communication media than\n",
      "social media, or avoiding certain applications. A slightly smaller proportion (25%) has changed their use of\n",
      "phones, e-mail, or search engines following Snowden. Knowing more about government surveillance\n",
      "produces more evidence of changed behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me say one more thing about the contexts of the surveillance culture. Having noted its\n",
      "relation to organizational dependence, political-economic power, security linkages, and social media\n",
      "engagement, I should also observe that surveillance culture has many facets and varies according to\n",
      "region. The point of using the concept of surveillance culture is to distinguish it from notions such as\n",
      "surveillance state or surveillance society by focusing on participation and engagement of surveilled and\n",
      "surveilling subjects. But surveillance culture will, like any culture, develop differently and often morph\n",
      "unpredictably, especially in contexts of increasing social liquidity (Bauman & Lyon, 2013). It will,\n",
      "moreover, bud and blossom differently depending on historical and political circumstance. Most of what is\n",
      "said here refers primarily to North America and Western Europe, although readers in Asia, Latin America,\n",
      "Africa, or the Middle East will recognize many features of surveillance culture, necessarily inflected by local\n",

      "surveillance culture, which, despite the singular-sounding concept, is nonetheless multifaceted and\n",
      "complex. As an increasing proportion of our social relationships is digitally mediated, subjects are\n",
      "involved, not merely as the targets or bearers of surveillance, but as more-and-more knowledgeable and\n",

      "be described as its subjects. Using the work of Charles Taylor on “modern social imaginaries” as a\n",
      "springboard, it is suggested that two interrelated terms, surveillance imaginary and surveillance practice\n",
      "may be used to marshal analyses of how those immersed in the digital world (and beyond, of course; the\n",

      "in terms of compliance with institutional surveillance, whether governmental or corporate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking this further, it is suggested that to grasp the ethical and political challenges of digital\n",
      "modernity, a concept such as surveillance culture is vital. Why? Because the dominant public and\n",
      "academic discourses about surveillance are couched in terms of the surveillance state or surveillance\n",
      "society. Neither of these is adequate today, not least because they tend to accent the viewpoint of the\n",
      "surveillor, the agent of surveillance, and often fail to give place to the ways that (what are called here)\n",
      "surveillance imaginaries and practices produce complacency, compliance, negotiation, or resistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "This strategy of deliberately analyzing the surveillance imaginaries and practices of surveillance\n",

      "also helps to connect with other significant debates about how to respond, for example, to the disclosures\n",

      "approaches, seen for some time as sorely inadequate to the task of confronting contemporary\n",

      "Considering the significance of surveillance culture is a fruitful way of going beyond earlier\n",

      "situations, but are of limited value in providing a full-orbed understanding of today’s surveillance—\n",
      "especially in the mainly online contexts discussed. Much more work will be needed to fill out this work\n",

      "Basically, the ethics regulates human behavior in doing\n",
      "something, whether someone doing the right thing or wrong\n",
      "thing. In determining whether someone doing is true or not,\n",
      "ethic is more concerned to the acceptability by his social\n",
      "environment. In this sense, ethics are social centric. An\n",
      "individual can not properly claim that his action is right\n",
      "ethically, unless their social environment consider it correct.\n",
      "This is consistent with what is stated in the [3], that ethic is\n",
      "relationship conduct pattern based on respect own rights and\n",
      "others against their environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ethics is closely related to philosophy, so that several\n",
      "definitions of ethics would involve the word philosophy in it.\n",
      "As stated in [4], ethics is a branch of philosophy that is\n",
      "concerned with human conduct, more specifically the behavior\n",
      "of individuals in society. Other definition in [5] says that ethics\n",
      "is a branch of philosophy that deals with what is considered to\n",
      "be right and wrong. In [6], it is described that Ethics is a branch\n",
      "of philosophy that studies morals and values. In addition,\n",
      "another definition states that the field of ethics (or moral\n",
      "philosophy) involves  systematizing, defending, and\n",
      "recommending concepts of right and wrong behavior [7].\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two aspects in the definition of ethics: being able\n",
      "to determine what is right or wrong, good or bad and a\n",
      "commitment to doing what is right and good [4]. Ethics\n",
      "examines the rational justification for our moral judgments; it\n",
      "\n",
      "studies what is morally right or wrong, just or unjust [4]. Ethics\n",
      "are a subset of values: a value applies to things that are desired\n",
      "as well as what one ought to do, and can include such concepts\n",
      "as wealth, happiness, success, and fulfillment [4].\n",
      "\n",
      "If we examine some various explanations above, it appears\n",
      "that ethics is closely related to morality. However, ethics can be\n",
      "not the same as morality. As hinted in [8], morality will be\n",
      "understood as the set of norms that guide our factual behavior\n",
      "whereas ethics is seen to be the theory and reflection of\n",

      "As stated in [7], philosophers today usually divide ethical\n",

      "ethics, and applied ethics. Metaethics investigates where our\n",
      "ethical principles come from, and what they mean [7].\n",
      "Metaethical answers to these questions focus on the issues of\n",
      "universal truths, the will of God, the role of reason in ethical\n",
      "judgments, and the meaning of ethical terms themselves [7].\n",
      "When compared to normative ethics and applied ethics, the\n",
      "field of metaethics is the least precisely defined area of moral\n",
      "philosophy [7]. We may define metaethics as the study of the\n",
      "origin and meaning of ethical concepts [7].\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike the metaethics, normative ethics takes on a more\n",
      "practical task, which is to arrive at moral standards that\n",
      "regulate right and wrong conduct [7]. This may involve\n",
      "articulating the good habits that we should acquire, the duties\n",
      "that we should follow, or the consequences of our behavior on\n",
      "others [7]. In a sense, it is a search for an ideal litmus test of\n",
      "proper behavior [7]. The Golden Rule is a classic example of a\n",
      "normative principle: We should do to others what we would\n",

      "\n",
      "The key assumption in normative ethics is that there is only\n",

      "intrusion upon privacy and personal integrity. Privacy can be seen as a protection\n",
      "of two kinds of basic rights:\n",
      "\n",
      "e Priority in defining ones own identity. (This implies the right to control the use of personal\n",
      "information that is disclosed to others, as personal information defines who you are for the\n",
      "others. As a special case the freedom of anonymity can be mentioned. In certain situations we\n",

      "special artifacts that are exclusively associated with a certain individual, such as a private\n",
      "diary or private letters - or disk space.) The privacy of ones’ home is a classic example of a\n",
      "private space which moreover is related to ones own identity. It is also an instructive\n",

      "Historically, as a result of experiences within different cultures a system of\n",
      "practices and customs has developed that defines what is to be considered personal\n",
      "and what is public, see (Warren and Brandeis, 1890), (Thompson, 2001). A basic\n",

      "\n",
      "According to Mason (2000), privacy can be studied through the relationships of\n",
      "four social groups (parties). The first party is the individual himself/herself. The\n",
      "second party consists of those others to whom the first party provides specific\n",
      "personal information for the sake of creating or sustaining a personal relationship\n",
      "or in return for services. The third party consists of all of the other members of\n",
      "society who can get access to an individual’s private information, but who have no\n",
      "professional relation to the individual and no authority to use the information.\n",
      "Finally, the fourth party is general public who are in no direct contact with the\n",
      "individual’s private space or information. During the interaction between parties,\n",
      "individuals invoke different levels of privacy. The advantages of close\n",
      "relationships are compared with the risks of the release of information and its\n",

      "requiring more attention than it has previously received in ethics, (Moor, 1997).\n",
      "This is due to reconceptualization of the private and public spheres brought about\n",

      "PRACTICES\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the fundamental questions related to the expansion of community\n",
      "networks is the establishment of fair information practices that enable privacy\n",
      "protection. At present it is difficult to maintain privacy when communicating\n",
      "through computer networks, which are continually divulging information. An\n",
      "example of a common concern is that many companies endeavor to obtain\n",
      "information about the behavior of potential consumers by saving cookies on their\n",
      "hard disks. Other possible threats against citizen’s privacy include the unlawful\n",
      "storage of personal data, the storage of inaccurate personal data, the abuse or\n",
      "unauthorized disclosure of such data that are issues surrounding government-run\n",
      "identity databases. Especially interesting problems arise when biometrics is\n",
      "involved (for identity documents such as passports/visas, identity cards, driving\n",
      "licenses). Remote electronic voting is dependent on the existence of voters’\n",
      "\f",
      "database, and there are strong privacy concerns if the same database is used for\n",
      "other purposes, and especially if it contains biometric identifiers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many countries have adopted national privacy or data protection laws. Such\n",
      "laws may apply both to data about individuals collected by the government and to\n",
      "personal data in the hands of private sector businesses. The OECD have defined\n",
      "fair information practices which include the following principles: Collection\n",
      "limitation, Data quality, Purpose specification, Use limitation, Security, Openness,\n",
      "Individual participation and Accountability (see OECD Guidelines on the\n",
      "Protection of Privacy).\n",
      "\n",
      "The exceptions to these principles are possible in specific situations, such as\n",
      "law enforcement investigations, when it might not be appropriate to give a suspect\n",
      "access to the information that the police are gathering. Nonetheless, the principles\n",
      "of fair information practices provide a framework for the privacy protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Legitimacy is a social concept developed during human history, meaning\n",
      "“socially beneficial fairness”. It concerns classical social problems such as the\n",
      "prisoner’s dilemma and the “tragedy of the commons” in which individuals may\n",
      "profit at the expense of society. Social interactions without legitimacy lead society\n",
      "into an unsustainable state.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, traditional mechanisms that support legitimacy, such as laws and\n",
      "customs are particularly ineffective in the cyberspace of today with its flexible,\n",
      "dynamic character, (Whitworth and de Moor, 2003). The remedy is the\n",
      "incorporation of legitimacy by design into a technological system. That process\n",
      "begins with a legitimacy analysis which can translate legitimacy concepts, such as\n",
      "freedom, privacy and intellectual property into specific system design demands. At\n",
      "the same time it can translate technological artifacts such as computer programs\n",
      "into statements that can be understood and discussed in terms of ethical theory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Legitimate interaction, with its cornerstones of trustworthiness and\n",
      "accountability, seems a key to the future of the global information society. This\n",
      "implies that democratic principles must be built into the design of socio-technical\n",
      "systems such as e-mail, CVE’s (Collaborative Virtual Environments), chats and\n",
      "bulletin boards, electronic voting systems and similar. As the first step towards that\n",
      "goal, the legitimacy analysis of a technological artifact (software/hardware) 1s\n",
      "suggested.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Trust is a broad concept, and making something trustworthy requires a social\n",
      "infrastructure as well as solid engineering. All systems fail from time to time; the legal\n",

      "no technology will ever be perfect.” (Mundie, at al., 2003)\n",
      "\n",
      "In any computer-mediated communication, trust ultimately depends not on\n",
      "personal identification code numbers or IP addresses but on relationships between\n",
      "people with their different roles within social groups. The trust necessary for\n",
      "effective democracy depends on communication and much of the communication is\n",
      "based on interaction over computer networks. Trust and privacy trade-offs are\n",
      "\f",
      "normal constituents of human social, political, and economic interactions, and they\n",
      "consequently must be incorporated in the practices of the e-polis. The bottom line\n",

      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "\n",
      "ICT supports and promotes the formation of new global virtual communities\n",
      "that are socio-technological phenomena typical of our time. In an e-democracy\n",
      "government, elected officials, the media, political organizations and citizens use\n",
      "ICT within the political and governance processes of local communities, nations\n",
      "and on the international stage. The ideal of e-democracy is greater and more direct\n",
      "citizen involvement. For the modern civilization of a global e-polis, the optimal\n",
      "functioning of virtual communities is vital. What are the basic principles behind\n",
      "successful virtual community environments? According to Whitworth there are two\n",
      "such principles:\n",
      "\n",
      "e =Virtual community systems must match the processes of human-human interaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "e Rights and ownership must be clearly defined.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is technically possible for ICT to incorporate these principles which include\n",
      "privacy protection via standards, open source code, government regulation etc.\n",
      "(Pottie, 2004, Tavani & Moor, 2000), including also trustworthy computing,\n",
      "(Mundie, at al., 2003).\n",
      "\n",
      "A process of continuous interaction and dialogue is necessary to achieve a\n",
      "socio-technological system which will guarantee the highest standards of privacy\n",
      "protection. Our conclusion is that trust must be established in ICT, both in the\n",

      "the critical question arises: Do those ethical guidelines have an actual impact on \n",
      "human decision-making in the field of AI and machine learning? The short answer \n",

      "\n",
      " \n",
      "First, the value assumption underlying this general version of the degeneration \n",
      "\n",
      "argument must be kept in mind. The assumption is that the capacity to think deep \n",
      "thoughts is both intrinsically and instrumentally valuable. There is credibility to this. \n",
      "Understanding something, or working out the solution to a problem, can be intrinsically \n",
      "rewarding. There is a degree of conscious satisfaction/achievement that comes from the \n",
      "personal achievement that is lost if you outsource a task to another person or thing. \n",
      "Also, solving a cognitive problem is clearly instrumentally rewarding: it enables us to \n",
      "get other good things (food, money, shelter, success, status etc.) that make life worth \n",
      "living. Indeed, according to one theory (Pinker 2010), the ability to solve cognitive \n",
      "problems is fundamental to why humans still exist to this day. But the intrinsic and \n",
      "instrumental rewards of thinking are dissociable and this has an important impact on the \n",
      "ethics of AI outsourcing. If the primary good of cognition is in the instrumental rewards \n",
      "it brings, then it is not clear that we lose anything by excessive AI outsourcing. Indeed, \n",
      "we may gain more than we lose. Take, once again, my example of the expenditure \n",
      "tracking and budgeting advice that is now automatically given out by my bank. This is \n",
      "instrumentally valuable to me. I am saving more money as a result of this cognitive \n",
      "outsourcing, and this enables me to get more of what I want in the future. Furthermore, \n",
      "since I did not enjoy the mental effort involved in solving this cognitive problem (it was \n",
      "not intrinsically rewarding to me), it seems like this particular instance of outsourcing is \n",
      "a win-win, despite the degenerating effects it may have. The same logic can apply \n",
      "across a whole suite of outsourcing options and degenerating effects. As long as I am \n",
      "embedded in a network of outsourcing devices that brings me the same (or better) \n",
      "instrumental rewards, and as long as I only rely on those outsourcing devices that solve \n",
      "problems I did not enjoy solving, there is little to lament. The only problem from an \n",
      "instrumental perspective is if I become decoupled from the network of outsourcing \n",
      "devices, or if the network of outsourcing devices breaks down. In those cases there will \n",
      "be knock-on negative effects to my well-being. Building up a degree of independent \n",
      "cognitive resilience could save me from these negative effects, but should I want to do \n",
      "this? That really depends on how likely decoupling and breakdown are, and how severe \n",
      "the effects will be. The reality is that in the modern era total disconnection is relatively \n",

      "13 \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, as Heersmink argues (2015), the existence of these networks changes the \n",
      "instrumental rewards that are available to us. It could be that I am rewarded for being an \n",

      "scarcity, time scarcity etc) also suffer knock-on cognitive deficits (Shah, Mullainathan \n",

      "instrumental values within our cognitive ecology that was raised earlier when discussing \n",

      "message lies in conveying truthful information about my safe arrival, not in my \n",
      "consciously sending it at that particular moment in time. So whenever we have a case in \n",

      "might sometimes lie in the fact that it is an immediate conscious expression of your \n",
      "feelings (e.g. if you are in a face-to-face setting and your partner says ‘I love you’, \n",
      "sending a text message hours later that reciprocates might not cut it). At other times the \n",

      "confront the paradox of internal automaticity. Throughout this article we have been \n",
      "assuming that automation involves outsourcing cognitive performance to a machine \n",
      "(AI) that is external to your body and mind. But this assumption is not quite right. \n",
      "Automation can happen inside the body too. When you first learn how to do something \n",
      "(like ride a bike or drive a car or talk in front of an audience) it requires intense, \n",
      "occurrent, conscious effort: you have to think and represent each stage of the \n",
      "performance in order to get it right. But once the performance is mastered it becomes \n",
      "automatic: a subconscious routine that you can easily perform without the intense \n",

      "This is, prima facie, paradoxical. Both internal automaticity and external automation \n",

      "it seems like the former should be too. If, when my partner says ‘I love you’ and I \n",
      "automatically and without thinking say ‘I love you’ back, this would seem to be just as \n",
      "problematic as if I got an app to send the message on my behalf (if we assume, \n",

      "out of what we do because it is routine. Those who think that this is fine but that \n",

      "There are at least three ways to address the paradox. The first is simply to concede \n",
      "defeat and accept that internal automaticity is just as much a problem as external \n",
      "automation, at least in those contexts where immediate conscious participation in an act \n",
      "is ethically preferred. This does not weaken the objection to the use of personal AI \n",
      "assistants, but it does suggest that the objection lies within a more general objection \n",
      "namely: thoughtless engagement in certain activities. Personal AI assistants are then \n",
      "problematic to the extent that they encourage or foster this thoughtlessness. The second \n",
      "way to address the paradox is to suggest that internal automaticity is less of problem \n",
      "due to its locus of control. This gets us back into the earlier debate about autonomy and \n",
      "manipulation. It could be that the internally automated behaviours are more under the \n",
      "control of the biological agent than external automating devices (which may be \n",
      "controlled by corporations with ulterior motives). This allows the objector to maintain \n",
      "some principled distinction between the two phenomena, but it’s not clear how \n",
      "persuasive the distinction is. Many internally automatised behaviours (e.g. default \n",
      "greetings and utterances) are the product of external cultural forces acting on the \n",
      "biological agent. These forces may also have ulterior motives or unwelcome \n",
      "consequences, e.g. automatised deference to one’s perceived social superiors is common \n",
      "in hierarchical societies and may serve to perpetuate the inequalities in such societies. A \n",
      "third way to address the paradox is to appeal to a conservative bias, i.e. to say that \n",
      "because internal automaticity has deeper biological and cultural roots, it is less morally \n",
      "problematic than external automation. Indeed, depending on how we interpret the \n",
      "conservative bias, we may even be inclined to presume that it this internal automaticity \n",

      "internal automaticity is an essential conserved evolutionary resource: it is a way of \n",

      " This article has examined the ethics of personal AI assistants. It has argued that \n",
      "we should look at the use of such technology through an ecological lens: as something \n",
      "that changes the cognitive ecology in which we operate and that requires careful \n",
      "consideration of the effects within that ecology, particularly in terms of the tradeoff \n",
      "between instrumental and intrinsic value. It has assessed some paradigmatic ethical \n",
      "objections to the personal use of AI assistants, arguing that while none of them amounts \n",
      "to knockdown objection to the practice, they do raise important concerns. Responding \n",
      "to those concerns allows us to draft an initial framework for thinking about the sensible, \n",
      "ethical use of personal AI assistance. The framework comes as a series of ethical \n",
      "risk/reward guidance principles that ask users to pay attention to potential risks in \n",
      "certain contexts and to tailor their use of AI assistance in response to those risks: \n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Degeneration Risk/Reward: When using AI assistants, one should be aware of the \n",
      "potential for cognitive degeneration with respect to an assisted task. If the task is one \n",
      "whose primary value is instrumental, and if the risk of being decoupled from the AI \n",
      "assistant is minimal, then this may not be a problem. But if the primary value of the task \n",
      "is intrinsic, and/or the risk of decoupling is high, it is probably best to cultivate one’s own \n",
      "cognitive capacities for the task. \n",
      " \n",
      "Autonomy Risk/Reward: When using AI assistants, one should be aware of the potential \n",
      "threat to autonomy due to (a) the fact that AI can sever the link between choice and result \n",
      "and (b) the fact that AI assistants can design the choice-architecture in which we make \n",
      "decisions. But one should bear in mind that AI assistants do not pose a unique and special \n",
      "threat to autonomy – many cultural and environmental forces already structure choice \n",
      "architectures in problematic ways – and that there is a danger in adopting a narrative of \n",
      "helplessness in relation to such threats. One should, consequently, approach personal AI \n",
      "assistants with the same discernment with which we approach existing threats. \n",
      "Furthermore, one should bear in mind that if the assistance comes in a domain with a lot \n",
      "of options, then the pre-selection may be advantageous and autonomy-enhancing. \n",
      " \n",
      "Interpersonal Virtue Risk/Reward: When using AI assistants to mediate interpersonal \n",

      "comes from immediate, conscious engagement in the performance of that action. To the \n",
      "extent that AI assistants replace that immediate, conscious engagement, they should be \n",
      "avoided. Nevertheless, in many other cases, the value of interpersonal actions lies in their \n",

      "variety of sectors including healthcare, transportation and the production chain4. In light of \n",
      "its powerful transformative force and profound impact across various societal domains, AI \n",
      "has sparked ample debate about the principles and values that should guide its development \n",

      "National and international organisations have responded to these societal fears by \n",

      "Many initiatives suggest ethical challenges can best be addressed through “technical and design \n",
